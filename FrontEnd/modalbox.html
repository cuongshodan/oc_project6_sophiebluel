          This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued

          Human contact: the final frontier. …And the fluffy kitten played with
          that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a
          Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night. No children have
          ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it.

          They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day. And here I
          am using my own lungs like a sucker. Dear Mr. President, There are too
          many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. <strong> P.</strong>
          <em>S.</em> I am not a crackpot.

          When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom
          of a bottle, they're on TV! Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a
          *New* Mexico? He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?! Inflammable
          means flammable? What a country.

            I've had it with this school, Skinner. Low test scores, class after
            class of ugly, ugly children…

          <li>
            That's why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe

            Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel

          And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker. Oh, everything looks
          bad if you remember it. You don't like your job, you don't strike. You
          go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way.

            Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this
            thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom.

          Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours. Son, a
          woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over
          your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna
          drink another woman!

        <p>
          Save me, Jeebus. Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me!
          Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico? I'm going to
          the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back
          for ten minutes!

          I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Hi. I'm Troy
          McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke
          Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!"

          Thank you, steal again. D'oh. I've done everything the Bible says —
          even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! You don't win friends
          with salad. How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy
          who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a
          society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police
          Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did
          you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects
          and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.

          Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns." Uh, no, you got the wrong

          And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker. Well, he's kind of had
          it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually,
          replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son."

          What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here
          anyway. Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making
          babies and I saw one of the babies and then the baby looked at me.

          Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never
          had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the
          bowl?* Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but
          secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes,
          brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king!

          Inflammable means flammable? What a country. Oh, so they have Internet
          on computers now! Beer. Now there's a temporary solution. You don't
          win friends with salad. Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the
          welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work.
